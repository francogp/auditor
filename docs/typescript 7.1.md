# TypeScript 7.1

Let’s take a look at what’s new in TypeScript 7.1!

## Support for Import Attributes in Ambient ModulesCopy link

[Import attributes](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/import/with) are metadata that are attached to import statements.
Typically, they’re meant to instruct runtimes and bundlers on how to interpret the content of an import, as well as the shape of the resulting module.
For example,

Copy

```typescript
import myData from './data/someData.json' with { type: 'json' };
```

Everything in the object following the `with` keyword is an import attribute.
Environments like browsers can’t simply decide how to deal with an import based on file name extensions like `.json`.
Specifying `type: "json"` tells whatever runtime that `someData.json` needs to be interpreted as a JSON file, parsed out, and provided via a default import (in our example above, that’s `myData`).

The `type` attribute has become the de facto way for runtimes to customize this behavior.
[ECMAScript (JavaScript) has a proposal](https://github.com/tc39/proposal-import-text) that allows code to specify `type: "text"`, which returns the import’s contents as a string.

Copy

```typescript
import readme from '../README.md' with { type: 'text' };

console.log(readme);
```

There is [also a proposal](https://github.com/tc39/proposal-import-bytes) for `type: "bytes"` to return a `Uint8Array` of raw bytes.

Copy

```typescript
import photo from './myPhoto.png' with { type: 'bytes' };
import { pngToPixels, boxBlur } from './photoUtils.js';
const blurryPhoto = boxBlur(pngToPixels(photo));
```

Browsers have also allowed importing CSS files as `CSSStyleSheet`s with `type: "css"` for a few years now.

Copy

```typescript
import someTheme from './themes/someCoolTheme.css' with { type: 'css' };

document.adoptedStyleSheets.push(someTheme);
```

To support importing these files, people might use _ambient module declarations_ in TypeScript using a wildcard pattern (e.g. `*.css`).

Copy

```typescript
// You can write this in a global `.d.ts` file with no import statements.

declare module '*.css' {
  const content: CSSStyleSheet;
  export default content;
}

declare module '*.txt' {
  const content: string;
  export default content;
}

declare module '*.md' {
  const content: string;
  export default content;
}

declare module '*.bin' {
  const content: Uint8Array;
  export default content;
}
```

This is okay, but it doesn’t work for all environments as it doesn’t account for import attributes at all.

You might ask why this is an issue – at first glance, it seems like the only problem is that it just allows people to accidentally leave off an import attribute.

Copy

```typescript
// ❌ oops, forgot an import attribute
import readme from '../README.md';
// ✅ what we were supposed to write
import readme from '../README.md' with { type: 'text' };
```

But that is still a problem worth fixing.
Another issue is that it becomes repetitive.
With import attributes, the entire issue is that the runtime cares about the attributes, not the file extension.
We shouldn’t have to re-declare a pattern for both `.txt` and `.md` files if both were going to use `type: "text"`.

But a major issue is that runtime environments may support different import attributes entirely, and may act differently depending on whether they’re present.
For example, bundlers might use a build-time feature called [CSS Modules](https://github.com/css-modules/css-modules) as the default behavior when importing `.css` files, but specifying the browser-supported `type: "css"` in the import statement will override this behavior and ensure the `.css` file is brought in as a `CSSStyleSheet` object.

That’s why TypeScript 7.1 introduces support for import attributes in ambient module declarations.
You can now declare the following in your TypeScript projects, get an error if you try to import a file without the required import attributes, and get the correct type based on the import attributes.

Copy

```typescript
declare module "*" with { type: "css" } {
    const content: CSSStyleSheet;
    export default content;
}

declare module "*" with { type: "text" } {
    const content: string;
    export default content;
}

declare module "*" with { type: "bytes" } {
    const content: Uint8Array;
    export default content;
}
```

Note that imports matching these declarations are not validated against files on disk.
As is currently the behavior when an import matches an ambient module declaration, failed lookups will be reported at runtime or during a bundler’s build process.

Also note that these declarations are not shipped as part of the TypeScript built-in libraries.
We recommend libraries **not** include them in their published packages, and end-users will need to declare them in their own projects if necessary.
That will provide end-users with flexibility on how the global scope is configured (e.g. `lib.dom.d.ts` versus `@types/node`) and will prevent conflicts with built-in declarations in the future.

For more information, see [our implementing pull request here](https://github.com/microsoft/TypeScript/pull/63931).

## Source Phase ImportsCopy link

[Source phase imports](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/import/source) are [a proposed new feature in ECMAScript](https://github.com/tc39/proposal-source-phase-imports).
The feature introduces a new `source` modifier/keyword that follows the `import` keyword.
Only default imports can be written with `import source`.

Copy

```typescript
import source SomeModule from 'some-module';
```

The idea with this feature is that when we use `import source`, we’ll get back an object that represents the module after it’s been parsed and analyzed by the runtime, but _before_ its imports have been loaded (and therefore, before they have been validated or linked against other modules, and before any code contained in the module can run).
This object on its own is kind of “inert” – it’s an instance of something called an `AbstractModuleSource` which is _eventually_ meant to be imported or instantiated.

For WebAssembly (wasm) imports, that object will be an instance of a `WebAssembly.Module`.
What’s useful with these objects is that they can be passed directly into `WebAssembly.instantiate`.

Copy

```typescript
import { WASI } from 'node:wasi';

import source SuperFastThing from './super-fast-thing.wasm';

const wasi = new WASI({/*...*/});
const fastThingInstance = await WebAssembly.instantiate(SuperFastThing, {
  wasi_snapshot_preview1: wasi.wasiImport
});

wasi.start(fastThingInstance);
```

WebAssembly source imports are already supported [in recent versions of Node.js](https://beta.docs.nodejs.org/esm#wasm-source-phase-imports).

At the moment, you can’t do much with a source import of a JavaScript file.
The spirit of the proposal implies at some point we might be able to pass a JavaScript module source directly into an `import()` call.

Copy

```typescript
import source SomeModule from './someModule.js';
const moduleInstance = await import(SomeModule);
```

Another part of the idea with JavaScript source imports is that, over time, we may gain other features that will allow us to be able to customize behavior around how modules are loaded and instantiated, similar to how we did with `WebAssembly.instantiate` above.
But we’re not there yet, and in fact, many environments and tools still don’t currently support JavaScript source imports in the first place.

Source imports aren’t limited to import statements though.
You can also perform a _dynamic_ source import as well via the `import.source` meta-property function.

Copy

```typescript
const SuperFastThing = await import.source('./super-fast-thing.wasm');
const fastThingInstance = await WebAssembly.instantiate(SuperFastThing, {
  // ...
});
```

Source imports retain identity.
That means you can use them in `Map`s and `Set`s, or compare against them reliably.

Copy

```typescript
// Note that `WebAssembly.instantiate` always returns a distinct object.
import source source1 from './plugin.wasm';
import source source2 from './plugin.wasm';
const source3 = await import.source('./plugin.wasm');

console.log(source1 === source2); // true
console.log(source2 === source3); // true
```

When using `import source`, every imported module has the type `AbstractModuleSource`, a new global type in `lib.esnext.d.ts`.
You must have an appropriate `--module` setting (i.e. `esnext`, `nodenext`, or `preserve`) to use source imports, as well as the appropriate `esnext` option in `--lib` or `--target`.

[This feature was implemented](https://github.com/microsoft/TypeScript/pull/63915) thanks to the work of [Oleksandr Tarasiuk](https://github.com/a-tarasyuk).

## `--target es2026`Copy link

TypeScript 7.1 now supports `es2026` as a stable `--target` and `--lib` option.
Only `lib` additions are significant, as declarations have been added, or moved from `esnext` as proposed features have stabilized in ECMAScript 2026.

Stabilizations in `--lib es2026` include:

- `Math.sumPrecise()`
- `Iterator.concat()`
- `JSON.rawJSON()`
- A `JSON.parse()` overload for parsing with original text
- `Error.isError()`
- `Map.prototype.*`
  - `getOrInsert()`
  - `getOrInsertComputed()`
- `WeakMap.prototype.*`
  - `getOrInsert()`
  - `getOrInsertComputed()`
- `Uint8Array.prototype.*`
  - `toBase64()`
  - `setFromBase64()`
  - `toHex()`
  - `setFromHex()`
- `Uint8Array.fromHex()`
- `Uint8Array.fromBase64()`
- `Array.fromAsync()`

[The work of](https://github.com/microsoft/TypeScript/pull/64096) creating the new targets, as well as many of the declaration files themselves, was done thanks to [Oleksandr Tarasiuk](https://github.com/a-tarasyuk).

## New Library MethodsCopy link

`--lib esnext` now includes a few proposed library methods in ECMAScript including:

- [`Promise.allKeyed` and `Promise.allSettledKeyed`](https://github.com/tc39/proposal-await-dictionary)
- [`Iterator.zip` and `Iterator.zipKeyed`](https://github.com/tc39/proposal-joint-iteration)
- [`Iterator.prototype.chunks`](https://github.com/tc39/proposal-iterator-chunking)
- [`Iterator.prototype.join`](https://github.com/tc39/proposal-iterator-join)
- [`Iterator.prototype.includes`](https://github.com/tc39/proposal-iterator-includes)

Support for these [`Promise` methods](https://github.com/microsoft/TypeScript/pull/64093) and [`Iterator` methods](https://github.com/microsoft/TypeScript/pull/64095) was provided thanks to [Oleksandr Tarasiuk](https://github.com/a-tarasyuk).

## TypeScript 7.1 APICopy link

TypeScript 7.1 ships a new API that allows building powerful tools and utilities using our syntactic and semantic analyses.

Rather than exposing a monolithic API, TypeScript 7.1 is organized into several entry points, each serving a specific purpose.

| Entry point              | Purpose                                                                                       |
| ------------------------ | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `typescript/sync`        | A synchronous compiler client, which supports compiler options, type-checker and program APIs |
| `typescript/async`       | A `Promise`-based equivalent of the sync client                                               |
| `typescript/fs`          | Request-scoped full and layered filesystems                                                   |
| `typescript/ast`         | Syntax tree node (AST) types and enums such as `SyntaxKind` and `ScriptTarget`                |
| `typescript/ast/is`      | Node type guards                                                                              |
| `typescript/ast/factory` | `create*` and immutable `update*` functions                                                   |

Here’s an example of how to conduct a simple compilation using the TypeScript 7.1 API, with filenames and compiler options passed explicitly on the command line.
Unlike `tsc`, this example does not discover or load a `tsconfig.json` file and does not support `--project`.

Copy

```typescript
// Compile explicit filenames using command-line compiler options.

import { API, formatDiagnosticsWithColorAndContext, type Diagnostic } from "typescript/sync";

using api = new API();
const reportErrors = (diagnostics: readonly Diagnostic[]) => {
    console.log(formatDiagnosticsWithColorAndContext(diagnostics, api))
};

// Parse command-line filenames and compiler options, report any errors.
const commandLineArgs = process.argv.slice(2);
const parsedCommandLine = api.parseCommandLine(commandLineArgs);
if (parsedCommandLine.errors.length > 0) {
    reportErrors(parsedCommandLine.errors);
    process.exit();
}

// Create the program by resolving and parsing all files in the entry point.
using program = api.createProgram(parsedCommandLine.fileNames, parsedCommandLine.options);

// Collect and report any diagnostics from the program before emitting.
// You can customize whether any of these block reporting errors in subsequent passes if desired.
const diagnostics = [\
    ...program.getGlobalDiagnostics(),\
    ...program.getProgramDiagnostics(),\
    ...program.getSyntacticDiagnostics(),\
    ...program.getSemanticDiagnostics(),\
];
if (diagnostics.length > 0) {
    reportErrors(diagnostics);
}

// Emit files - this respects the `noEmitOnError` option,
// so nothing will be emitted if an earlier step reported errors.
const emitResult = program.emit();
if (emitResult.diagnostics.length > 0) {
    reportErrors(emitResult.diagnostics);
}
```

Notice the `using` keyword in our declarations above.
You might not be familiar with [`using` since it’s somewhat new in JavaScript](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/using), but don’t fret.

`API` instances and `Program` instances are both [`Disposable` objects](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Symbol/dispose).
When we ask to create them, TypeScript allocates memory and does book-keeping to make sure they stick around between the Go and JavaScript runtimes;
however, when we are done with them, we can’t just let the garbage collector deal with them or else we’ll leak on the Go side.
Instead, we have to do one of the following:

- manually dispose of them with explicit method calls (e.g. `api.close()`, `program.dispose()`, or `api[Symbol.dispose]()`), or
- automatically dispose of them when they go out of scope by declaring them with the `using` keyword.

After a program is disposed, we won’t be able to use it again.

### SnapshotsCopy link

Above, we modeled a straight-line “batch” compilation with the API;
but lots of workflows with TypeScript are oriented around changes that might occur over time.
Rather than build up the entire world every time we need, TypeScript is able to model transitions in state with new file updates – either on disk or as a user types.

Core to the API is the concept of a _snapshot_.
A snapshot is a version of all the projects and programs at a point in time.
We can always create a fresh snapshot with all the information we need with `api.createSnapshot`, but we can also derive a new snapshot from a prior one with the `snapshot.update(/*...*/)`.
This can often save a lot of work, both in sending over all the original information and having the compiler rebuild the world.

Copy

```typescript
import { ScriptTarget } from "typescript/ast";
import { createFileSystemLayer, createFileSystemWithLib } from "typescript/fs";
import { API } from "typescript/sync";
import { resolve } from "node:path";

const fileName = resolve("snapshot-example.ts");

using api = new API();
using before = api.createSnapshot({
    fileSystem: createFileSystemWithLib([\
        [fileName, 'export const answer: number = "forty-two";'],\
    ]),
    createPrograms: [\
        {\
            rootFiles: [fileName],\
            compilerOptions: {\
                strict: true,\
                noEmit: true,\
                target: ScriptTarget.ES2022,\
            },\
        },\
    ],
});

using beforeProgram = before.operation.createdPrograms[0];
console.log("before:", beforeProgram.getSemanticDiagnostics().length);

using after = before.update({
    fileSystem: createFileSystemLayer([\
        [fileName, "export const answer: number = 42;"],\
    ]),
    ensurePrograms: [beforeProgram.id],
});

using afterProgram = after.getProgram(beforeProgram.id);
if (!afterProgram) {
    throw new Error("The updated program was not found.");
}

console.log("after:", afterProgram.getSemanticDiagnostics().length);
console.log("before again:", beforeProgram.getSemanticDiagnostics().length);

// Outputs:
//  before: 1
//  after: 0
//  before again: 1
```

We’ll come back to those file system APIs in a bit.

One thing to notice here is that we were able to start with an original snapshot named `before` and derive a new snapshot after making a change called `after`.
Snapshots can contain `Program` objects (and `Project`s) which have `id`s that persist between snapshot changes.
We used `ensurePrograms` to specify the `Program`s which we care to observe updates on in the new snapshot (the current default is lazier and allows you to stack `update()` calls without forcing updates to `Program`s).

Notice that even after calling `update`, we’re able to use information from the prior snapshot.
For example, we can still ask for diagnostics on both `beforeProgram` and `afterProgram`.
That said, make sure you don’t mix and match objects derived from one snapshot’s program, project, or checker.

Snapshots are `Disposable`s like our other types above, so we’ll need to either manually `dispose()` them or create a local binding for them with `using` declarations.
After a `Snapshot` is disposed, we can’t use it again.

### File System APIsCopy link

By default, TypeScript’s APIs will operate over the host file system.
That means that it will hit files “on disk” unless we say otherwise.

| Function                         | Behavior                                                                                                 |
| -------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `createFileSystem(files)`        | Defines a complete file system. Unlisted files are absent, unless explicitly mounted.                    |
| `createFileSystemWithLib(files)` | Defines a complete file system and mounts the compiler’s default library directory read-only.            |
| `createFileSystemLayer(files)`   | Overrides selected files while falling back to the base snapshot’s file system, or the host file system. |

In our earlier example, we created a (partial) virtual file system with `createFileSystemWithLib` and specified only the file in our program that we cared about.
When we wanted to make an update, we were able to just use `createFileSystemLayer` for only the files that changed, and other files (like `lib.d.ts` and anything else) continued to resolve through the base file system layer that we made in our initial snapshot.

Copy

```typescript
// ...

using snapshot = api.createSnapshot({
    fileSystem: createFileSystemWithLib([\
        [\
            mainFile,\
            [\
                'import { greeting } from "./generated.js";',\
                "export const message: string = greeting;",\
            ].join("\n"),\
        ],\
        [generatedFile, 'export const greeting = "Hello from memory!";'],\
    ]),
    createPrograms: [\
        {\
            rootFiles: [mainFile],\
            compilerOptions: {\
                strict: true,\
                module: ModuleKind.ESNext,\
                moduleResolution: ModuleResolutionKind.Bundler,\
                target: ScriptTarget.ES2022,\
            },\
        },\
    ],
});

using program = snapshot.operation.createdPrograms[0];

// ...
// Get emit without writing files to any file system.
const emitResult = program.emitToString();
```

There are some ways to control how files are observed over these layers.
For example, `removedPaths` can block out requests from the underlying system.

If you need to provide some level of file watching, that currently needs to be done separately.
File creations/deletions/modifications need to be provided via the `fileNotifications` option in `snapshot.update()`.
Any modifications that occur that aren’t in the _host_ file system need to be provided with another file system layer.

### Content MappersCopy link

TypeScript has long had powerful checking and tooling for TypeScript and JavaScript code;
however, lots of developers use specialized file types for writing out their components.
For example, Vue.js has regions of HTML, JavaScript, and CSS all within a single `.vue` file, along with embedded regions for JavaScript in that HTML.
The same is true for libraries like Astro, Ember, Svelte, and others – these frameworks follow a similar way of declaring their components.
At some point, a project called Volar emerged to provide TypeScript tooling for these single-file component formats to provide a seamless development experience in the editor.
Volar surfaces errors, code completions, navigation, and more by using TypeScript’s language services, and has been able to extend its capabilities to other formats, such as MDX files.

Unfortunately, one of the challenges with Volar was that TypeScript lacked some of the APIs to easily provide a cohesive experience.
For example, while Volar’s model shined for editor support, command-line type-checkers for these other file formats could not really use Volar because they integrate with completely different APIs from TypeScript.
Another issue was the fact that Volar either had to embed TypeScript as a subcomponent and completely take over the editor experience, or it had to use awkward workarounds to integrate with the existing TypeScript tooling given limitations in our APIs.
With TypeScript 7.0, we took an opportunity to rethink how the toolset could better support formats that embed JavaScript and TypeScript code.
In fact, with TypeScript 7.1, Volar’s core model is now a first-class citizen.

TypeScript 7.1 introduces support for a new plugin point called _content mappers_.
A content mapper can be registered with a specific file extension, and is able to produce a virtual representation of a file for TypeScript to see.
This representation also has regions that map back to the original file, typically in the regions that contain the corresponding JavaScript or TypeScript code.
That allows TypeScript to provide more accurate error messages and spans, and provide tooling for these embedded regions.

To use a content mapper, you’ll need to register it with a specific set of extensions in your project’s `tsconfig.json`.
For example, if we installed a package called `@vue/content-mapper` (which is _not_ currently on npm), we could include it in our `tsconfig.json` as follows:

Copy

```json
{
  "compilerOptions": {
    // ...
  },
  "contentMappers": [\
    {\
      "package": "@vue/content-mapper",\
      "extensions": [".vue"],\
      "options": {\
        "target": 3.5\
      }\
    }\
  ]
}
```

Whenever a file is included in the program – whether that’s via `files`/`include` in your `tsconfig.json`, or through an `import`, TypeScript will check for registered content mappers and request content and mappings for that file.
We can then run directly from the command line.

Copy

```bash
tsc --runExternalCode
```

Note the `--runExternalCode` flag, which is required to allow TypeScript to execute content mappers.
Content mappers are effectively arbitrary executables that TypeScript dispatches to, so the `--runExternalCode` flag makes that explicit.

In editors like VS Code, TypeScript 7.1 “just works” with content mappers, though it requires both workspace trust and content mapper permissions to be granted.
In our VS Code extension, you’ll have the power to also disable this entirely by configuring the new `js/ts.contentMappers.enabled` setting.

Content mappers have already been prototyped or implemented for various libraries and frameworks, including:

- [Astro](https://github.com/withastro/astro/pull/17835)
- [CSS Modules](https://github.com/remcohaszing/css-modules-content-mapper)
- [Ember](https://github.com/NullVoxPopuli/ember-content-mapper/)
- [MDX](https://github.com/remcohaszing/mdx-content-mapper)
- [Svelte](https://github.com/sveltejs/language-tools/pull/3111)
- [Vue](https://github.com/vuejs/language-tools/pull/6170)

We even have [an example content mapper for HTML files](https://github.com/DanielRosenwasser/content-mapper-sample) supporting `<script>` tags and event handler attributes.

For more information, [see the write-up of content mappers on the implementing pull request](https://github.com/microsoft/typescript-go/pull/4712).

### More on the APICopy link

We’ll have more examples of our API in the near future, but we’re working with partner teams to ensure TypeScript 7.1’s API is both ergonomic and provides the appropriate performance for real-world usage.
Feel free to give us some feedback on what works and doesn’t work for you!

## Notable Behavioral ChangesCopy link

This section highlights a set of noteworthy changes that should be acknowledged and understood as part of any upgrade.
Sometimes it will highlight deprecations, removals, and new restrictions.
It can also contain bug fixes that are functionally improvements, but which can also affect an existing build by introducing new errors.

### `lib.d.ts`Copy link

Types generated for the DOM may have an impact on type-checking your codebase.
For more information, [see linked issues related to DOM and `lib.d.ts` updates for this version of TypeScript](https://github.com/microsoft/TypeScript/issues/63702).

### Stronger Checks When Using Distributive Type ParametersCopy link

In TypeScript, a conditional type which evaluates against a type variable (e.g., `T` in `T extends Whatever ? TrueType : FalseType`) will distribute over union types when they are supplied in place of that type variable.
For example:

Copy

```typescript
type Foo<T> = T extends 'a' | 'b' | 'c' ? { known: T } : { unknown: T };

// { known: "a" } | { known: "b" } | { unknown: "x" } | { unknown: "y" }
type Bar = Foo<'a' | 'b' | 'x' | 'y'>;
```

Here, `T` is a type parameter, and the string literal types `"a"`, `"b"`, `"x"`, and `"y"` are each individually evaluated against the type on the right side of the `extends`.
The appropriate branch is instantiated for each member of the union, and the resulting types are then unioned together for the type of `Bar`.

While in each branch of the conditional type above we referred to `T`, that is not _quite_ the same `T` as the original type parameter.
When distributing, `T` will represent a more specific subset of the original union type.
However, previous versions of TypeScript did not distinguish the two.

Copy

```typescript
type Show<A extends number, B extends A> = `${B} extends ${A}`;

type Issue<A extends number, B extends A> = A extends B ? never : Show<A, B>; // We shouldn't be allowed to write this branch!
```

In the type `Issue`, we wrote out `Show<A, B>` in the false branch, and we’ll show why that shouldn’t be allowed.

The `Show` type ensures that its second type parameter is a subtype of the first.
Under TypeScript 7.0 and prior, that seemed true – the `Issue` type declares that `B extends A`, so why wouldn’t that be the case?
Well distribution throws a wrench in that assumption.

Copy

```typescript
// Forms the string literal type `"0 extends 1"`
type UhOh = Issue<0 | 1, 0>;
```

Again, the problem is that while a literal type like `0` is a subtype of the union `0 | 1` as a whole, cracking the union apart in each branch really leaves us with distinct types that could be unrelated.
You can reframe this in a different way: a `Cat` might be a subtype of `Animal`, but it certainly won’t be a subtype of every type of `Animal`.

TypeScript 7.1 is stricter about this.
In each branch, you can effectively think of `T` being a new type parameter that is a subtype of the original, but won’t have any relation with other types constrained to the original type parameter.

Copy

```typescript
type Show<A extends number, B extends A> = `${B} extends ${A}`;

type Issue<A extends number, B extends A> = A extends B ? never : Show<A, B>;
//              ~
// error!
// Type 'B' does not satisfy the constraint 'A'.
//   'B' is only assignable to the non-distributed 'A', but 'A' has been distributed here.
```

Code that encounters this may need to be modified, either removing the original constraint if it’s unnecessary or adding additional conditional type checks to satisfy required constraints of other types.
